# Asynchronous-Code-in-JavaScript
Asynchronous Code in JavaScript
Explore the world of asynchronous JavaScript through hands-on exercises. This project showcases the power of promises and async/await through real-world APIs.

Project Overview
This project offers a platform to practice asynchronous JavaScript operations using two methodologies:

Promises
Async/Await (to be implemented after practicing with promises)
Features:
Fetch interesting number facts from the Numbers API.
Engage with the Deck of Cards API to draw and display cards.
Dive into the vast Pokemon world and get detailed information about random Pokemon from the Pokemon API.
Getting Started
Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone [repository-url]
cd asynchronous-js/
Open the HTML file in a browser
You can use any web server utility to serve the index.html or open it directly in a browser.

Interact with the Project
Click on the respective buttons to activate the various asynchronous operations.

Structure
index.html is the main file containing the UI elements.
styles.css provides a touch of styling to the project.
main.js contains the core JavaScript code responsible for the asynchronous operations.
Further Development
Async/Await: After implementing features with promises, re-implement the same features using async/await for practice and comparison.
Error Handling: Add comprehensive error handling to manage unforeseen circumstances.
Enhance UI/UX: Improve the design and user experience by integrating frontend frameworks/libraries.
